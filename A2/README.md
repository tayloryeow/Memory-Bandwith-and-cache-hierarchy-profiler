Compiling and using the main project
====================================

Assuming you are in the main directory:

```sh
make pgm_creator
./pgm_creator
```

This will create the header/source files with the big, hardcoded images. Then
simply run:

```sh
make main
```

For the correct usage, refer to the output of:

```sh
./main
```
